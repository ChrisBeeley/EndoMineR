Title: Functions to mine endoscopic and associated pathology datasets
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: This script comprises the functions that I use to clean up endoscopic 
             reports and pathology reports as well as many of the scripts used for analysis.  
             The scripts assume the endoscopy and histopathology data set is merged already but it can 
             also be used of course with the unmerged datasets.
