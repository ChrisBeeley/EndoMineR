\usage{
TermStandardLocation(x, SampleLocation)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The dataframe}

\item{SampleLocation}{Column describing the Macroscopic sample from histology}

\description{
Standardises the location of biopsies by cleaning up the common typos and
abbreviations that are commonly used in free text of pathology reports
}
\examples{
#Firstly we extract histology from the raw report
# using the extractor function
Histoltree <-list("Hospital Number:","Patient Name:",
"General Practitioner:","Date received:","Clinical Details",
 "Nature of specimen","Histology","Diagnosis",""
)

for (i in 1:(length(Histoltree) - 1)) {

}

# The function then standardises the histology terms through a series of
# regular expressions
