    <h1>Extracts the columns from the raw report</h1>
    </div>

    
    <p>This is the main extractor for the Endoscopy and Histology report.
This depends on the user creating a list of words or characters that
act as the words that should be split against. The list is then fed to the
Extractor in a loop so that it acts as the beginning and the end of the
regex used to split the text. Whatever has been specified in the list
is used as a column header. Column headers don't tolerate special characters
like : or ? and / and don't allow numbers as the start character so these
have to be dealt with in the text before processing</p>
