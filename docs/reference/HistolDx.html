    <p>This extracts Diagnosis data from the report. The Diagnosis is the overall
impression of the pathologist for that specimen. At the moment, Only Capital
D included (not lower case d) to make sure picks up subtitle header as
opposed to mentioning 'diagnosis' as part of a sentence.  Column specific
cleanup and negative remover have also been implemented here.</p>
